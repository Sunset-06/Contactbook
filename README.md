# ðŸ“’ A little Contact book project

I'm making this as I go about learning React and Express for building webapps.

The frontend needs a lot of work done, but it's functional as it is right now.

[Deployed on Render](https://contactbook-o7uy.onrender.com)

(It might take a while to load as Render shuts off the server on downtime)

If you want to run it on dev server, run these commands in the root directory (assuming you have npm installed):

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
