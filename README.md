# ðŸ“’ A little Contact book project

I'm making this as I go about learning React and Express for building webapps.
[Deployed on Render](https://contactbook-o7uy.onrender.com)

(It might take a while to start as Render shuts off the server on downtime)

If you want to run it on dev server, run these commands in the root directory (assuming you have npm installed):

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
The frontend_code directory will have to be built to a production build for the changes to take effect in the dev server.

Simply use ``npm run build`` in the frontend directory, which should output a folder called dist, then transfer this folder to the outer directory.

So far this only works with one database, which means that there is a shared pool of public contacts. I plan on adding authentication to it as soon as I figure out how to do so.
